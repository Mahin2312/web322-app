        <h2 class="text-primary">About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mahin Ibne Alam, and my nickname is Nirob, bestowed upon me by my mother. I came into this world in 2004 in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. However, I grew up in the vibrant capital city of Dhaka. My parents, originally from Rajshahi, moved to Dhaka seeking better opportunities for our family. My educational odyssey led me through South Point School and Academia, where I completed my high school education in 2022. The dream of studying abroad took root early, inspired by my sister's pursuit of education overseas. Now, I am proud to be a student at Seneca College, embarking on a journey in Computer Programming and Analysis. My aspiration is to hone my programming skills and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.</p>
        <p>We are a family of five. My father, a determined entrepreneur, and my mother, the heart of our home, instilled in me values of hard work and perseverance. I'm blessed with two elder sisters, both accomplished graduates. One resides in Oshawa, Ontario, having embraced Canada as her new home, while the other stays close by in Dhaka.</p>
